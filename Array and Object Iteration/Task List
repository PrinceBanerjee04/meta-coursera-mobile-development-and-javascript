Task: Iterate Over an Array

In this exercise, you'll use the for....of loop to iterate over an array and to iterate over an object's own properties.  
<br><br>
**Step 1.** You are given an array of dairy products:  

    
    var dairy = ['cheese', 'sour cream', 'milk', 'yogurt', 'ice cream', 'milkshake']
    


Create a function called `logDairy`. Within it, console log each of the items in the dairy array, using the for...of loop.   

After you create this function, call it as `logDairy()` to see the output on the console.

The expected output should be:

```
cheese
sour cream
milk
yogurt
ice cream
milkshake
```

<br>
<b>Step 2.</b> You are given the following starter code:  

```
const animal = {

canJump: true

};

const bird = Object.create(animal);

bird.canFly = true;

bird.hasFeathers = true;
```

Create a function called `birdCan`, within it, loop over the bird object's properties and console log each one, using the for...of loop. Finally call the function as `birdCan()` to see the output on the console.
Remember, you need to console log both the key and the value of each of the bird object's properties.

<br/>
Expected output should be:

```
canFly: true
hasFeathers: true
```


<br>
<b>Step 3.</b> 
    Using the same starter code as in task 2, create a function called `animalCan` and within it, loop over all the properties in both the bird object and its prototype - the animal object - using the for...in loop. Finally call the function as `animalCan()` to see the output on the console.

<br/><br/>
Expected outout should be:

```
canFly: true
hasFeathers: true
canJump: true
